These programs demonstrate the use of IPC shared memory and implement Peterson's algorithm for multi-process synchronization for N process.

Master reads a file of strings and places them into shared memory, then forks off N simulteaneous processes. Each child process exec's the Palin program.
Palin checks whether its string is a palindrome or not and places the string in the corresponding file.
When Palin terminates, Master replaces the process with a new child until all the strings have been checked.

This program also implements SIGINT and SIGALRM signal handling.

To make this program, issue: make master palin
To run this program, issue: ./master -f filename

To change the number of simulteaneous processes, change the SIMULTEANEOUS_PROCESSES definition in master.h
To change the number of total strings, change the LIST_SIZE definition in master.h
